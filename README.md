Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you understand game theory and basic search  algorithms.


 Proficiency in Python 

 To implement an AI agent for Tic-Tac-Toe, several key skills are essential. Proficiency in Python programming is fundamental, enabling you to structure the game and implement the AI logic. Understanding game theory concepts, such as optimal strategy and decision-making, is crucial for designing an unbeatable AI. 


 Minimax algorithm

 Knowledge of search algorithms, specifically the Minimax algorithm, is necessary for exploring possible game states and choosing the best moves. Familiarity with Alpha-Beta Pruning can enhance the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm by reducing the number of nodes evaluated. Additionally, problem-solving skills and logical thinking are vital for handling various game scenarios and ensuring the AI operates correctly. 


  Depth-first search 

  depth-first search techniques will also be beneficial in implementing the Minimax algorithm effectively. Overall, these skills combine to create a robust and intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe AI that provides a challenging experience for human players.
